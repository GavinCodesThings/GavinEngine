# GE
GE (Gavin Engine) is a set of tools made to help you analyze software easier.

## Inspiration and Credits
This software is heavily inspired by Cheat Engine, so huge thanks go to them for the idea.

This project also uses SharpDisam and Procyon Decompiler, so credits go to them as well.

## Why did you make this?
I mainly wanted to create a reverse engineering program for educational purposes, and wanted to share the code with you guys.

## How does it work?
If you choose to use the disassembler, it opens the file (without needing it to be opened).

If you choose to use the Memory Scanner, it will either attach a DLL to the process to read/write memory, or read/write the processes memory externally.

## What features does GE have?
### Disassembler
Translates a program's machine code into semi-readable assembly code.

### Disassembly "Rewriter"
Rewrites assembly code to make it a bit easier to understand.

### Disassembly Decompiler
Uses assembly code to generate C pseudo code.

### Java Decompiler 
Decompiles a .jar file into .java files.

### Memory Scanner
Allows you to scan for different values in a processes memory.
