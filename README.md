# GE
GE (Gavin Engine) is a set of tools made to help you analyze software easier. This repository only has source code for the FREE version of GE.

## Inspiration and Credits
This software is heavily inspired by Cheat Engine, so huge thanks go to them for the idea.

This project also uses SharpDisam and Procyon Decompiler, so credits go to them as well.

## Why did you make this?
I mainly wanted to create a reverse engineering program for educational purposes, and wanted to share the code with you guys.

## What features does GE have?
### Disassembler (Pro & Free)
Translates a program's machine code into semi-readable assembly code.

### Disassembly "Rewriter" (Pro)
Rewrites assembly code to make it a bit easier to understand.

### Disassembly Decompiler (Pro) (WIP)
Uses assembly code to generate C pseudo code.

### Java Decompiler (Pro & Free)
Decompiles a .jar file into .java files.

### Memory Scanner (Pro & Free)
Allows you to scan for different values in a processes memory.
